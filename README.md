# Process Manager Simulator

## Basic
In plan to develop my knowledge in C language, i developed that software.
It deals with terminal commands to create processes. On the moment of the execution, all processes are put on a queue and will be executed with FIFO or RR scheduling algoritms.

## How to use
Basically, there's a makefile on the source code.
You can compile the source code using gcc and gnu-make.
Using the following command will compile the source code:

```
make compile
```

The command above automatically deletes the .o files, but you can use the following command:

```
make clean
```
